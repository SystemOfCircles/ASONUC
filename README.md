# ASONUC

A Series Of Non Useful Cogs (ASONUC) Is A Repository Of Discord py Cogs That May Or May Not Be Really Useless.

  - ASONUC Is Primarily Designed To Allow The Cogs To Be Loaded By Any Bot. 
  
  - A Basic Bot File Is Included That Automatically Loads All Cogs In The Cogs Folder For Testing.
